# mongo-news

### Project Description

This project is intended to demonstrate a how to access and retrieve news content from an external, publicly-available website. The retrieved content is then stored in a local database and rendered on a local web page. In this example, the app is a "full-stack" JavaScript application that sends an HTTP request to http://www.echojs.com/. The application allows end users to store notes that are associated with specific news articles.

Technologies used in this app include the following:

* JavaScript - As a "full-stack" programming language
* jQuery - A client-side JavaScript library for working with the browser's Document Object Model (DOM)
* Node.js - JavaScript runtime
* Axios (package) - JavaScript library for performing server-side HTTP requests in Node.js
* Cheerio (package) - jQuery implementation for parsing, traversing, manipulating markup in Node.js
* Mongoose (package) - Object Data Model (ODM) package for Node.js used to interface with a MongoDB database via JavaScript
* MongoDB (database) - NoSQL database used to store data in JSON format
* Express.js (package) - Node.js package used to create a web server
* Heroku - Web application hosting platform
